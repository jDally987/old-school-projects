These are all of the old projects that I did for school (the ones I stll have saved, anyway), all in chronological order.

Everything before 2012 was high school, everything after was college.

All are written in Java, mostly in eclipse, so the project files can be imported into eclipse for your viewing pleasure.
They are mostly for my own archiving purposes, to show off how far I've come programming skills-wise (if at all), and to laugh at the cheeky comments I used to make in my programs.
